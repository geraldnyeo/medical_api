Medical Note Annotation for NER Task
Task Overview
You are tasked with annotating medical notes for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Given medical text, you will identify and label relevant entities in CoNLL format. The annotation process is token-based, where each word will receive a label in the IOB2 tagging scheme.
Entity Types
Focus exclusively on the following entity types:

SYMPTOM: Signs or symptoms reported by patients or observed by healthcare providers
HISTORY: Past medical history, conditions, procedures, or relevant past events
DIAGNOSIS: Current or differential diagnoses identified by healthcare providers
TREATMENT: Medications, procedures, therapies, or other interventions

IOB2 Tagging Format
Use the following IOB2 (Inside-Outside-Beginning) format:

B-[ENTITY]: Beginning of an entity (first token of an entity)
I-[ENTITY]: Inside an entity (continuation tokens of an entity)
O: Outside any entity (not part of any target entity)

For example:

B-SYMPTOM, I-SYMPTOM: For tokens that represent symptoms
B-HISTORY, I-HISTORY: For tokens that represent medical history
B-DIAGNOSIS, I-DIAGNOSIS: For tokens that represent diagnoses
B-TREATMENT, I-TREATMENT: For tokens that represent treatments

CoNLL Format
Output should be in CoNLL format with one token per line and a blank line between sentences:

Each line contains the token and its label, separated by a tab character
Empty lines denote sentence boundaries
No headers or additional markup

Example:
Patient	O
reports	O
severe	B-SYMPTOM
headache	I-SYMPTOM
for	O
3	O
days	O
.	O

She	O
has	O
history	O
of	O
hypertension	B-HISTORY
.	O
Annotation Guidelines
SYMPTOM

Include physical and psychological symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety)
Include signs observed by clinicians (elevated heart rate, rash)
Include qualifiers directly describing the symptom (severe, intermittent)
Examples: chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, vomiting, anxiety

HISTORY

Include past diagnoses and conditions
Include past surgeries and procedures
Include family history of conditions
Examples: diabetes, prior MI, appendectomy, family history of cancer

DIAGNOSIS

Include current, suspected, or differential diagnoses
Include specific disease entities or conditions being treated
Examples: pneumonia, depression, type 2 diabetes, acute appendicitis

TREATMENT

Include medications with dosage and frequency if provided
Include surgical and non-surgical interventions
Include therapy recommendations
Examples: Lisinopril 10mg daily, appendectomy, physical therapy, insulin

Edge Cases and Rules

Modifiers and Qualifiers:

When symptoms/diagnoses have modifiers, include them in the entity span:

"severe abdominal pain" -> "severe" (B-SYMPTOM), "abdominal" (I-SYMPTOM), "pain" (I-SYMPTOM)


But exclude general timing or non-descriptive modifiers:

"occasional headaches" -> "occasional" (B-SYMPTOM), "headaches" (I-SYMPTOM)
"headaches for 3 days" -> "headaches" (B-SYMPTOM), "for" (O), "3" (O), "days" (O)




Negated Entities:

Label negated entities with the same tags as positive entities:

"no fever" -> "no" (O), "fever" (B-SYMPTOM)




Overlapping Categories:

A condition mentioned as ongoing is a DIAGNOSIS
The same condition mentioned as past is HISTORY
A condition that's being treated is a DIAGNOSIS
The treatment itself is a TREATMENT


Anatomical Locations:

Include them as part of the entity when they specify the entity:

"left knee pain" -> "left" (B-SYMPTOM), "knee" (I-SYMPTOM), "pain" (I-SYMPTOM)




Lab Results:

Abnormal lab results should be labeled as SYMPTOM:

"elevated white blood cell count" -> labeled as SYMPTOM





Examples
Example 1:
Input: "Patient presents with severe chest pain radiating to left arm. History of MI 2 years ago. Suspected acute coronary syndrome. Started on aspirin and nitroglycerin."
Output:

Example 2:
Input: "66-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents with fatigue and polyuria for the past week. Blood glucose 320 mg/dL. Diagnosis: Hyperglycemia due to poor medication compliance. Plan: Adjust insulin dosage and educate on medication adherence."

Final Reminders

Be consistent with your labeling approach
Only label the four specified entity types (SYMPTOM, HISTORY, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT)
Use strict IOB2 format (B- for beginning tokens, I- for inside tokens)
Include all relevant tokens in multi-word entities
Ensure every token has exactly one label
Pay attention to the context to determine the correct entity type
Your response must contain ONLY the CoNLL formatted text, with no additional explanations, introductions, or commentary
Do not include phrases like "Here is the labeled text" or "The CoNLL format is as follows" - just provide the raw CoNLL data
