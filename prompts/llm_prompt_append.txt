You are a annotator labelling data for a natural language processing named entity recognition dataset.
You are annotating clincal notes, and are required to identify the words or phrases corresponding to symptoms, patient history, diagnoses and treatments.
Return an exact copy of the text provided, adding appropriate labels where required, to mark the important medical entities in the text. 
Note: entities are significant words or phrases, referring to a single significant concept or item.
The possible labels are: 
 - X-SYM, entity describing a symptom which the patient exhibits
 - X-SYM-X, entity describing a symptom which the patient does not exhibit
 - X-HIS, entity describing patient's medical history of a symptom, illness or treatment
 - X-HIS-X, entity describing medical history which the patient does not have
 - X-DIA, entity describing diagnosis by the doctor 
 - X-TRT, entity describing treatment prescribed by the doctor
Try to keep labelled entities short, and do not label additional information, instead, focus on key terms.

Please refer to the following example:

"**Name:** Tian Jie Foo  
**Age:** 28  
**Gender:** Male  
**Ethnicity:** Chinese  
**Service Type:** NSMen (Officer)  
**Rank:** 2LT(NS)  
**PES:** A  
**Vocation:** Infantry Trooper  
**Reason:** PES Review (Downgrade)

---  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient reports a 6-month history of progressively worsening symptoms consistent with **major depressive disorder (MDD) with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**. He describes persistent anhedonia, insomnia (delayed sleep onset and early morning awakenings), and a 6 kg unintentional weight loss over 4 months. He endorses daily ruminative thoughts of worthlessness, guilt over perceived occupational inadequacy, and passive suicidal ideation without intent. Notably, he experienced a panic attack during a recent field exercise, characterized by palpitations, diaphoresis, and derealization, prompting premature withdrawal. He discloses social withdrawal from peers and impaired concentration affecting tactical decision-making during drills. There is a history of one suicide attempt via medication overdose 3 months prior, managed emergently at a civilian hospital. No prior psychiatric history reported. 

**On Examination:**  
- **Mental Status Examination (MSE):**  
  - **Appearance:** Disheveled grooming, psychomotor retardation.  
  - **Affect:** Flat, with labile tearfulness during discussion of symptoms.  
  - **Mood:** ""Hopeless"" (self-rated 2/10 on subjective mood scale).  
  - **Thought Content:** Negative self-appraisal, guilt, and pessimism about military role.  
  - **Cognition:** Impaired attention (serial 7s test incomplete), delayed recall.  
  - **Insight/Judgment:** Partial insight into illness; judgment compromised by fatigue and indecisiveness.  
- **Physical:** Mild tachycardia (HR 102 bpm at rest), BMI 19.2 (down from 21.6).  
- **Functional Assessment:** Marked impairment in operational readiness, including inability to tolerate prolonged physical exertion or high-stress scenarios without decompensation.  

**Impression:**  
1. **Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, severe with anxious distress (DSM-5 296.33)**.  
2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks (DSM-5 300.02)**.  
3. **History of suicide attempt (ICD-10 X60-X84)**.  

Given the **severity and chronicity of symptoms**, including **functional impairment in combat-related duties** and **persistent suicidality**, the patient is **medically unfit for PES A**. The **risk of harm under high-stress, combat-operational environments** necessitates a **PES downgrade**.  

**Plan:**  
1. **Refer to SAF Medical Board** with recommendation for **downgrade to PES C9** (temporarily unfit for combat/operational duties due to psychiatric condition).  
2. **Immediate restrictions**: Excuse from live-firing exercises, night operations, and prolonged field training pending board review.  
3. **Psychiatric follow-up**: Initiate SSRI (sertraline 50 mg OD) with titration guided by SAF Psychiatrist; cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) twice weekly to address maladaptive thought patterns.  
4. **Safety monitoring**: Weekly check-ins with unit medical officer for suicide risk assessment.
5. **Occupational review**: Temporary administrative redeployment to light administrative duties during treatment phase.
