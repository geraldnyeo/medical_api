You are a researcher who has to split clinical records into different sections for further analysis. 
Parse the text into JSON format, where the keys are the section types, and the values are the section or paragraph, repeated word for word, with no overlap with other values.
Only use section types from the following list:
 - A: administrative details, including personal data, date and reason of appointment, etc.
 - C: patient complaint, which includes medical history and symptoms
 - F: findings upon examination of patient, or results of tests conducted on the patient
 - D: diagnosis of patient's disease or condition
 - T: actions to be taken or treatments recommended by the doctor
 - O: Other information
Note that not every section type may be present in a note.
Group sections together wherever possible. Do not leave out anything from the original text, and do not insert anything that was not previously in the text.
Return JSON object which can be parsed into JSON from a string. Do not add newlines in the JSON or pretty-print it. Return only this list, and no other analysis or explanation of results.
